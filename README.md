# ðŸ“º How long can you last? ðŸ“º
Demo version of a web-based project about our level of tolerance towards harsh and disturbing images in documentary photography (mainly war-related).
<br>
The proof of concept uses and ML algorithm to detect the viewer gaze and blinks, without storing any specific information or image about the identity of the viewer.
<br>
The viewer is then presented with a series of images fired in rapid sequence which stop as soon as the viewer blinks.
