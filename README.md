# ðŸ“º How long can you last? ðŸ“º
Demo version of a web-based project about our level of tolerance towards harsh and disturbing images in documentary photography (mainly war-related).
<br>
The proof of concept uses and ML algorithm to detect the viewer gaze and blinks, without storing any specific information or image about the identity of the viewer. This works better when you use no glasses, your face is in clear light and without a strong source of light coming from the back.

The viewer is then presented with a series of images fired in rapid sequence which stop as soon as the viewer blinks. How long can you last?
